                <h1>Hi, I'm Sofia!</h1>
                <p>
                I am a rising senior at Carnegie Mellon University studying Information Systems with a minor in Cybersecurity and International Conflict. 
                I have experience in cybersecurity consulting, specializing in transforming incoming client data into ECS format and working with Penetration 
                Testing Services to identify system weaknesses. I am also working towards obtaining my CISA, AWS, and CIPP certifications, with long-term plans 
                to attend law school in 5-10 years.<br><br>

                When I'm not managing projects or enhancing my knowledge in cyber law, I enjoy visiting my parents in Miami to reconnect with my Cuban roots, 
                or traveling to Madrid, Spain, where I grew up, to visit friends.<br><br>
                
                I will be graduating from Carnegie Mellon with my Bachelor's degree in May 2025, and <b>I am actively seeking a full-time position
                in Software Development or Project Management starting Summer/Fall 2025</b>.
                <br><br>
